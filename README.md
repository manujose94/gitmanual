## Git â€“ File states

**Tracked files**

These are files that were in the last snapshot (aka); they can be in one of the following sub states:

-  unmodified

        These are any files that haven't been modified since the last commit. They will still be included in the next commit, but remain as is.

-  modified

        These are files that have been modified since the last commit (we probably modified these as part of bug fixes). These files will be included in the next commit, but will be included in thier respective new form.

-  staged

        These are files that are either not present in the last commit (e.g. newly created files) or are "modified" files that we tell git to include in the next commit. Files are added to the staging using git's "add" command.

-  untracked file

        These are any files that are not being tracked, i.e. git isn't of the existance of these files. You can change the state of these files to "tracked - staged" by using git's "add" command
